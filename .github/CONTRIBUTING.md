# Contributing to Kelp

Want to help grow and improve Kelp? Awesome! ❤️

Right now, while Kelp is alpha and I'm still defining the shape of it, the best way you can help is by testing it, breaking things, and [opening issues](https://github.com/cferdinandi/kelp/issues) when you encounter bugs. If you have feature requests, please open an issue for those, too!

In the future, I'll be adding more details around coding standards and how to properly contribute to the project. Please note that any Pull Requests must agree to the _Kelp Contributor License Agreement_ below in order to be merged into the project. This allows me to dual license PRs under the Kelp Commons and Kelp Pro/Enterprise licenses.

Thanks!
