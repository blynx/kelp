## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it are governed by the Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. 


## v0 Alpha

Right now, Kelp is alpha and I'm still defining the shape of it. 

The best way you can help is by testing it, breaking things, and [opening issues](https://github.com/cferdinandi/kelp/issues) when you encounter bugs. If you have feature requests, please open an issue for those, too!


## Roadmap & Issues

Project management happens in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/cferdinandi/kelp/issues), and relies heavily on tags.

Here are some quick links to filter by category...

- [Documentation improvements](https://github.com/cferdinandi/kelp/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Adocumentation)


## Code Standards

The biggest things to keep in mind...

- Tabs, not spaces
- Document as needed
- Keep files small and modular

The rest you can probably pick up from looking at the existing code base or running `npm run lint` to run [Biome](https://biomejs.dev), the linter and code formatter for this project.

It will yell at you if you did something wrong, and offer suggestions on how to fix it.


## Pull Request Process

Before creating a PR, it's a good idea to...

- Comment on an existing issue asking if help is need and verify work isn't already in progress, or
- Create an issue and get feedback.

You don't _have_ to do either of these things, but it can prevent wasted or duplicated work.

**Optional nice-to-haves...**

- Written documentation on what was changed, why, and how it works
- In-code documentation (wherever needed)
- Tests for new components/features
- Linting to ensure style guidelines were followed
- Demo code

If you're missing any or all of these, no worries! I'll take care of it. But if you're able to do any of that work, it's immensely helpful.
